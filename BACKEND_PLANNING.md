# Backend Implementation Planning for Gaming Leaderboard

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing a backend API with authentication for the Gaming Leaderboard application. The work is broken down into focused GitHub issues that can be assigned and tracked.

## Overview

The current Gaming Leaderboard is a frontend-only application that loads player data from a static JSON file. This plan outlines the implementation of a full backend API with authentication, database integration, and admin capabilities.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Frontend Requirements
Based on the existing `DataService.js` and application architecture:

- **Data Structure**: Players with `id`, `playerName`, `points`, `lastActive`
- **Features**: Ranking system, seniority levels (10 levels based on points), statistics
- **Caching**: 5-minute client-side cache
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clear separation between data service, view models, and views
- **Prepared Methods**: `savePlayer()`, `updatePlayerPoints()`, `loadFromDatabase()`

### API Requirements
The backend needs to provide:
1. Player data retrieval (with sorting and filtering)
2. Player data management (CRUD operations)
3. Statistics calculation
4. Authentication and authorization
5. Admin panel functionality
