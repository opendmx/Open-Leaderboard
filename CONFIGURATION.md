# Flexible Leaderboard Configuration

This document explains how to use the flexible configuration features of the Open Leaderboard.

## Overview

The leaderboard supports flexible configuration through external JSON files that can be loaded via URL parameters. This allows customization of content, layout, styling, and behavior without modifying the core application code.

## Basic Usage

### Default Mode
```
http://localhost:8000
```
Shows the default leaderboard with predefined players and styling.

### External Configuration Mode
```
http://localhost:8000?config=your-config.json
```
Loads configuration from the specified JSON file, which can be a local file or external URL.

## Configuration File Structure

A configuration file is a JSON object with the following optional properties:

### Basic Configuration

## CSS Customization

Custom CSS files can override any aspect of the leaderboard styling:

```css
/* Custom header styling */
header h1 {
    color: #FFD700 !important;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5) !important;
}

/* Custom team column */
.team {
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #2196F3;
    text-align: center;
}

/* Enhanced hover effects */
.leaderboard-entry[style*="cursor: pointer"]:hover {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #fff3e0 0%, #ffe0b2 100%) !important;
    border-left: 4px solid #FFD700 !important;
}
```

## Error Handling

- If the external configuration file fails to load, the application falls back to default mode
- Invalid JSON configurations are logged to the console and ignored
- Missing custom CSS files are logged as warnings but don't break functionality
- Unknown field types in columns are rendered as text

## Performance Considerations

- Configuration files are cached for 5 minutes to reduce server requests
- Custom CSS is loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking the main interface
- Player images should be optimized for web (recommended: < 50KB each)

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Mobile responsive design maintained with custom configurations
