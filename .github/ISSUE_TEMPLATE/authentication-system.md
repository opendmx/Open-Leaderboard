## Overview
Design a comprehensive authentication system with role-based access control for the Gaming Leaderboard.

## Authentication Requirements
- [ ] User registration and email verification
- [ ] Secure login with password hashing
- [ ] JWT token-based authentication
- [ ] Session management and refresh tokens
- [ ] Password reset functionality
- [ ] Account lockout protection

## User Roles and Permissions
### Guest
- View leaderboard only
- No authentication required

### Player
- View leaderboard
- View own profile and statistics
- Update own profile information

### Moderator
- All Player permissions
- Manage player data
- Moderate content and profiles
- View audit logs

### Admin
- All Moderator permissions
- Full system access
- User role management
- System configuration

## Security Measures
- [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
- [ ] Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] Account lockout policies
- [ ] Audit logging for security events

## API Integration
- [ ] Middleware for token validation
- [ ] Role-based endpoint protection
- [ ] Token refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Logout and token invalidation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Authentication flow documented
- [ ] Role-based permissions matrix defined
- [ ] Security measures documented
- [ ] Token management strategy defined
- [ ] Account management workflows designed

## Implementation Notes
Authentication should integrate seamlessly with existing frontend without breaking current functionality. Consider OAuth integration for future social login features.
