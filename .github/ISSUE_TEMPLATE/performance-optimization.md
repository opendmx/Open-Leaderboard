## Overview
Design comprehensive performance optimization and caching strategy for high-traffic scenarios.

## Caching Strategy

### Database Level Caching
- [ ] Query result caching
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Read replica configurations
- [ ] Query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Materialized views for statistics
- [ ] Database partitioning strategies

### Application Level Caching
- [ ] Redis for session storage
- [ ] In-memory caching for frequent queries
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategies
- [ ] Cache warming procedures
- [ ] Distributed caching for scaling
- [ ] Cache hit ratio monitoring

### API Response Caching
- [ ] HTTP caching headers
- [ ] CDN integration for static content
- [ ] Response compression (gzip/brotli)
- [ ] Conditional requests (ETags, Last-Modified)
- [ ] Cache-Control strategies
- [ ] Edge caching optimization

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Performance
- [ ] Query optimization and profiling
- [ ] Index strategy for leaderboard queries
