## Overview
Design deployment pipeline and DevOps practices for reliable backend operations and seamless delivery.

## Deployment Strategy

### Containerization
- [ ] Docker container design
- [ ] Multi-stage build optimization
- [ ] Base image security considerations
- [ ] Container registry management
- [ ] Image versioning strategy
- [ ] Container health checks

### Orchestration
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Service mesh considerations
- [ ] Load balancer configuration
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Resource limits and requests
- [ ] Pod disruption budgets

### Deployment Patterns
- [ ] Blue-green deployment strategy
- [ ] Rolling updates configuration
- [ ] Canary deployment procedures
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Database migration strategies
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment

## Infrastructure as Code

### Environment Provisioning
- [ ] Infrastructure templates (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- [ ] Environment consistency
- [ ] Resource tagging strategies
- [ ] Cost optimization
- [ ] Security group configurations
- [ ] Network architecture

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Application configuration
- [ ] Environment-specific settings
- [ ] Feature flag management
- [ ] Service discovery
- [ ] External service integration
- [ ] Configuration validation

### Secrets Management
- [ ] Secret storage solutions
- [ ] Key rotation procedures
- [ ] Access control policies
- [ ] Audit logging for secrets
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD
- [ ] Development environment secrets

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
- [ ] Source code management
- [ ] Automated build processes
- [ ] Unit test execution
- [ ] Code quality gates
- [ ] Security scanning
- [ ] Artifact generation

### Continuous Deployment
- [ ] Automated deployment triggers
- [ ] Environment promotion
- [ ] Deployment verification
- [ ] Health check integration
- [ ] Notification systems
- [ ] Deployment metrics

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Distributed tracing
- [ ] Business metrics monitoring
- [ ] SLA/SLO monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- [ ] System resource monitoring
- [ ] Network performance tracking
- [ ] Database performance monitoring
- [ ] Container health monitoring
- [ ] Security event monitoring
- [ ] Cost monitoring and optimization

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategies
- [ ] Database backup automation
- [ ] Configuration backup
- [ ] Application state backup
- [ ] Cross-region replication
- [ ] Backup testing procedures
- [ ] Recovery time objectives (RTO)

### High Availability
- [ ] Multi-zone deployment
- [ ] Failover mechanisms
- [ ] Health check configurations
- [ ] Load balancing strategies
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns
- [ ] Graceful degradation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deployment architecture documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline designed and tested
- [ ] Infrastructure requirements defined
- [ ] Monitoring and logging strategy implemented
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan created and tested

## Implementation Notes
DevOps practices should enable rapid, reliable delivery while maintaining system stability and security.
