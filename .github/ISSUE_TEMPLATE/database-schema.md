## Overview
Design the database schema to support current features and future extensibility, plus define migration strategy from static JSON.

## Current Data Structure
```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "playerName": "DragonSlayer99",
    "points": 5245,
    "lastActive": "2024-01-15"
}
```

## Required Schema Extensions
- [ ] User authentication tables (separate from player profiles)
- [ ] Role-based access control
- [ ] Audit trails for point changes
- [ ] Player statistics and history
- [ ] Achievement system foundation
- [ ] Seniority level configurations

## Migration Requirements
- [ ] Preserve all existing player data
- [ ] Maintain data integrity during migration
- [ ] Zero downtime migration strategy
- [ ] Rollback capability
- [ ] Data validation and cleanup

## Performance Considerations
- [ ] Indexing strategy for leaderboard queries
- [ ] Efficient sorting and pagination
- [ ] Statistics calculation optimization
- [ ] Archive strategy for historical data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete database schema with ERD
- [ ] Migration scripts for existing JSON data
- [ ] Database indexes for performance
- [ ] Data validation rules defined
- [ ] Backup and recovery strategy

## Implementation Notes
Schema should support the 10-level seniority system and be extensible for future gaming features like achievements and tournaments.
