## Overview
Design system for real-time leaderboard updates and live notifications to enhance user experience.

## Real-time Features
- [ ] Live leaderboard position changes
- [ ] Real-time point updates
- [ ] Achievement notifications
- [ ] Player online status indicators
- [ ] Admin broadcast messages
- [ ] System maintenance notifications

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] WebSocket server implementation
- [ ] Message queuing for reliability
- [ ] Connection pooling and scaling
- [ ] Fallback to polling for compatibility
- [ ] Message authentication and authorization
- [ ] Connection state management

## Use Cases

### Player Perspective
- See position changes in real-time
- Receive achievement notifications
- View live player activity

### Admin Perspective
- Broadcast system messages
- Monitor real-time user activity
- Push urgent notifications

## Architecture Considerations
- [ ] WebSocket connection management
- [ ] Message serialization format
- [ ] Authentication for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Horizontal scaling with message brokers
- [ ] Client reconnection strategies
- [ ] Rate limiting for real-time messages

## Fallback Strategies
- [ ] Graceful degradation to HTTP polling
- [ ] Progressive enhancement approach
- [ ] Browser compatibility handling
- [ ] Network failure recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket architecture documented
- [ ] Message format and protocols defined
- [ ] Connection management strategy
- [ ] Scaling considerations addressed
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms designed

## Implementation Notes
Real-time updates should enhance the existing experience without breaking functionality for users with connection issues.
