## API Features
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Filtering and sorting options
- [ ] Rate limiting per endpoint
- [ ] Request/response validation
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] API versioning support
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

## Data Formats
Maintain compatibility with existing frontend data structures while adding extensibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Request/response schemas defined
- [ ] Error response standards documented
- [ ] Authentication requirements per endpoint
- [ ] Rate limiting policies defined

## Implementation Notes
API should maintain backward compatibility with existing `DataService.js` methods while adding new capabilities for admin features.
