## Overview
Establish comprehensive security measures and best practices for the backend system.

## Security Areas

### Input Validation and Protection
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection mechanisms
- [ ] CSRF protection implementation
- [ ] Parameter tampering protection
- [ ] File upload security

### API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] API security headers implementation
- [ ] Request size limits
- [ ] Timeout configurations
- [ ] Secure error handling
- [ ] API versioning security

### Data Protection
- [ ] Data encryption at rest
- [ ] Data encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)
- [ ] Secure key management
- [ ] Sensitive data masking
- [ ] Secure data deletion
- [ ] Database access controls

### Authentication Security
- [ ] Password policy enforcement
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication support
- [ ] Session security management
- [ ] Account lockout policies
- [ ] Secure token storage
- [ ] OAuth security considerations

## Compliance Considerations
- [ ] GDPR compliance for user data
- [ ] Data retention policies
- [ ] Privacy by design principles
- [ ] User consent management
- [ ] Data portability requirements
- [ ] Right to be forgotten implementation

## Monitoring and Response
- [ ] Security event logging
- [ ] Anomaly detection systems
- [ ] Automated threat response
- [ ] Security metrics and reporting
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Security audit trails

## Development Security
- [ ] Secure development lifecycle (SDLC)
- [ ] Code security scanning
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Secrets management in code
- [ ] Security testing integration
- [ ] Security code review processes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Security requirements documented
- [ ] Threat model created and analyzed
- [ ] Security testing strategy defined
- [ ] Compliance checklist created
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting plan established

## Implementation Notes
Security should be built-in from the start, not bolted on later. Consider security implications for every feature and endpoint.
