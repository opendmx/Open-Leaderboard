## Overview
Define the overall architecture and select appropriate technologies for the Gaming Leaderboard backend.

## Requirements
- [ ] Choose backend framework (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring, etc.)
- [ ] Select database technology (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- [ ] Define deployment strategy (Docker, cloud platforms)
- [ ] Establish coding standards and project structure
- [ ] Define environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)

## Technology Considerations
- **Performance**: High-throughput leaderboard queries
- **Scalability**: Support for growing user base
- **Maintainability**: Clean, testable code structure
- **Team Expertise**: Consider team's technology familiarity
- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing frontend

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Technology stack documented with justifications
- [ ] Project structure defined
- [ ] Development environment setup documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline strategy outlined
- [ ] Performance and scalability considerations documented

## Implementation Notes
Current frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with MVVM pattern. Backend should provide clean API endpoints that integrate seamlessly with existing `DataService.js`.
