# Backend Implementation - GitHub Issues Creation Guide

This document provides instructions for creating the GitHub issues outlined in the backend implementation planning.

## Issue Templates Created

The following issue templates have been created in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

### Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)
1. **backend-architecture.md** - Backend Architecture and Technology Stack
2. **database-schema.md** - Database Schema Design and Migration Strategy  
3. **api-endpoints.md** - RESTful API Endpoints Design

### Security and Authentication (Phase 2)
4. **authentication-system.md** - Authentication and Authorization System
5. **security-hardening.md** - Security Hardening and Best Practices

### Advanced Features (Phase 3)
6. **realtime-updates.md** - Real-time Updates and WebSocket Integration
7. **admin-panel.md** - Admin Panel and Management Interface

### Operations and Quality (Phase 4)
8. **performance-optimization.md** - Performance Optimization and Caching Strategy
9. **testing-strategy.md** - Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance
10. **devops-strategy.md** - Deployment and DevOps Strategy

## Creating the Issues

### Automatic Issue Creation
When contributors visit the "New Issue" page on GitHub, they will see these templates as options. Each template includes:

- Pre-filled title with `[CONCEPT]` prefix
- Appropriate labels (`concept`, plus specific technical labels)
- Pre-assigned to `danielmeixner` 
- Detailed description and requirements
- Clear acceptance criteria

### Manual Issue Creation
If creating issues manually, use the following format for each:

#### Standard Labels for All Issues
- `concept` (as requested)
- Plus specific technical labels per issue

#### Standard Assignee
- `danielmeixner` (as requested)

## Implementation Priority

Based on the planning document, the recommended creation and implementation order is:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Backend Architecture and Technology Stack
2. Database Schema Design and Migration Strategy
3. RESTful API Endpoints Design

### Phase 2: Security and Authentication  
4. Authentication and Authorization System
5. Security Hardening and Best Practices

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
6. Real-time Updates and WebSocket Integration
7. Admin Panel and Management Interface

### Phase 4: Operations and Quality
8. Performance Optimization and Caching Strategy
9. Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance
10. Deployment and DevOps Strategy

## Additional Issues to Consider

All major concept issues have been covered in the templates above. The 10 issue templates provide comprehensive coverage of:

- ✅ Core Infrastructure and Architecture
- ✅ Security and Authentication 
- ✅ Performance and Caching
- ✅ Testing and Quality Assurance
- ✅ Deployment and Operations
- ✅ Real-time Features
- ✅ Admin and Management Tools

If additional specialized issues are needed, they can be created following the same template pattern with:
- `[CONCEPT]` prefix in title
- `concept` label plus specific technical labels
- Assignment to `danielmeixner`
- Clear requirements and acceptance criteria

## Using the Templates

1. Navigate to the repository's Issues page
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Select the appropriate template
4. The template will auto-populate with:
   - Correct title format
   - Appropriate labels
   - Assigned to Daniel Meixner
   - Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria

## Related Documentation

- `BACKEND_PLANNING.md` - Comprehensive planning document with full context
- Individual issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Existing codebase analysis in the planning document

## Success Criteria

All issues should be:
- ✅ Tagged with `concept` label
- ✅ Assigned to Daniel Meixner  
- ✅ Include detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Reference the overall backend planning context
- ✅ Be actionable and well-scoped for implementation

## Next Steps

1. Review the created issue templates
2. Create the GitHub issues using the templates
3. Prioritize the issues based on the recommended phases
4. Begin detailed technical design for Phase 1 issues
5. Establish development timeline and milestones

This approach ensures systematic planning and implementation of the backend with proper authentication as requested in the original issue.
